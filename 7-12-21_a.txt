Suppose 
 
Display the sum of salaries for every manager whose manager is not null and that the sum of salaries should be greater than 10000.


HAVING clause

To restrict groups we use HAVING clause

syntax:

select column,grp_function(column)
from tablename
where condition
group by column or columns
having condition
order by column asc or desc;


select manager_id, sum(salary) from employees where manager_id is not null  group by manager_id having sum(salary) > 10000;



COUNT - It counts number of rows.

COUNT(*)- It counts all the rows duplicates and NULL values.

COUNT(expr)- It counts only duplicate rows but ignores NULL values.

COUNT(DISTINCT expr) -It counts only unique values and ignores NULL values.

COUNT(*)-select count(*) from employees;

COUNT(expr) -Display the number of employees in every department.

select department_id,count(employee_id) from employees group by department_id;
select count(manager_id) from employees;


Display the number of jobs in every department and that number of jobs should be greater than 2.

select count(job_id),department_id from employees group by department_id having count(job_id) >2;
 
select year(hire_date),count(employee_id) from employees group by year(hire_date) having count(employee_id) >10; 

SUBQUERIES-

Subquery is query within a query.
Subquery is also known as INNER QUERY.

Display the lastname salary of all employees whose salary is  greater than that of Kochhar.

syntax:

select column_list from tablename where column comparison opr (select column from tablename where condition(s));

select last_name,salary from employees where salary > (select salary from employees where last_name='Kochhar');


Rules-

1. Subquery is enclosed within parentheses.
2. Subquery is placed on the right side of the comparison condition of main query.
3. Single row operators are used for single row subqueries and multiple row operators for multiple row subqueries.

Single Row Operators- <,>,=,<> or != ,=<,>=
Multiple Row Operators- IN,ANY,ALL

Write a query to display  the last name and hiredate  of any employee in same department.

select last_name,hire_date from employees where department_id IN(select department_id from employees );

Display the name,department of those employees whose job_id is same as that of job_id with last name Greenberg.

select last_name,department_id from employees where job_id =(select job_id from employees where last_name='Greenberg');


Display the maximum salary in every department whose department is not 2,3,4 and that the maximum salary should be less than 10000.

select department_id,max(salary) from employees where department_id not in (2,3,4) group by department_id 
having max(salary) < 10000;
